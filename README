This is stub README file for project. It should be replaced with real later.

Initially project aim is to extend debian-installer environment with support
for partman disk profiles given at command line (e.g. simple-cdd/partman=10GB),
tiny storage installation (e.g. 1GB) using btrfs mixed data and metadata mode
with enabled compression, installation to btrfs subvolume (only single,
subvol=root), detection of destination drive and network install (e.g. PXE)
from CD/DVD.

In general simple-cdd-ext is a set of POSIX shell scripts intended to be
executed in debian-installer environment through system of hooks:

    preseed/run              # main, fetched from same source as preseed
    preseed/early_command
    preseed/late_command

    partman/early_command    # just before partitioning, all components loaded

These hooks used for integration with this extension. User specific actions to
configure debian-installer environment or perform specific actions on
installed system can be added to early_command.sh and late_command.sh helpers.

Now project evolves to separate subproject to make it possible for reuse by
other distributions like CentOS and Ubuntu. However name is retained to show
it's origins of simple-cdd helper. That support, among with updated README
file contents, should come later.
